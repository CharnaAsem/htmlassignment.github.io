<center><h1><font color="olive"> History of Algebra</font></h1></center>
<p>The history of algebra almost started from the 9th century and the contributions of mathematics of different countries are infinite.Modern algebra is the evolution of all their works which has made it easy.The solution of quadratic equations with any number of exponentials can be obtained for both positive and negative integers by simple arithmetic analysis.</p>

<p>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi,a persian mathematician whose works have wide influence in mathematics,astronomy and geography.He wrote the book "The compendious book on calculation by comlexion and balancing" from which the word ALGEBRA was coined.The book gives a systematic approach to solve linear and quadratic equations by reduction and balancing methods.He gave a unifying theory that created a new revolution in mathematical history where rational numbers,irrational numbers,geometrical magnitudes are treated as "Algebraic objects".His contribution to algebra made him to be addressed as"Father of algebra".</p>

<p>Euclid of Alexandria who is also known as "Father of Geometry" wrote a textbook named "Elements" which provides the framework for generalizing formulae beyond the solution of particular problems into more general systems of stating and solving equations.</p>

<p>Amalie Emmy Noether,a German mathematician,gave her contribution to abstract algebra.She developed the "Theorem of Rings,fields and algebras".Her works includes "Contribution to theories of algebraic invariants and number field".She developed "Theory of ideals in commutative rings" into a tool which had wide ranging applications that was published in her paper.She published papers on noncommutative algebra and hypercomplex numbers and united the representation theory of groups with the theory of modules and ideals(1927-1935).Her contribution to abstract algebra earned her the title "Mother of Algebra".</p>
