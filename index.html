        <font>Algebra is generalized arithmetic in which we represent the numbers by letters,known as literals numbers or simply literals.These letters do not have any fixed values and are called variables.In our real life scenario,we see some values that keep on varying.But there is a constant need to represent these fluctuating values.We come across many situations where the value of a constant keeps changing over time.So,we use a variable to store the continuous value when it changes.Algebra is one of the most important branches of mathematics where we introduce the concept of variables.We use algebra in higher mathematics also.We perform arithmetic operations using letters in algebra.We can apply algebra in our real life situations using algebraic expressions and equations.Calculations become magically faster with algebra and when in used computers,it becomes faster than anything imaginable.This is the true beauty of algebra,making everyday tasks easier,faster,and more reliable.It helps us to understand what is important in a sequence of events.Build problem-solving skills and reasoning skills-understanding how to move factors from one side of the equation to the other will help us to understand the balance of nature and how is all interrelated. </font>
