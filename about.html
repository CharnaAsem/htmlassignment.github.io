<p><font size="8" color="olive">BASIC CONCEPT OF ALGEBRA</font></p>
<p> Basics of algebra covers the simple operation of mathematics like addition,substraction,multiplication,and division involving both constant as well as variables.It is the branch of mathematics which uses the alphabetical letters to find unknown numbers which are called variables.The values which are known in the given expression such as numbers are constants.
	<p><font size="8" color="olive">DEFINITION</font></p>
	<p>Algebra is the branch of mathematics in which abstract symbols,rather than numbers are manipulated or operated with arithmetic.It is simply the part of mathematics that helps represent problems or situations in the form of mathematical expressions.</p>
	<p><font size="8" color="olive">Importance of algebra</font></p>
	<p>Algebra is faster and better than basic math.It also opens up whole new areas of life problems,such as graphing curves curves that cannot be solved with only math foundation skills.It is necessary to master statistics and calculus.It moves us beyond basic math and ptepares us for statistics and calculus.It is useful for many jobs some of which a student may enter as a second career.Algebra is useful around the house and in analyzing information in the news.It also reinforces logical thingking and is beautiful.</p>
	<p><font size="8" color="olive">Branches of Algebra</font></p>
	<p>Algebra is divided into different sub-branches such as elementary algebra,advanced algebra,abstract algebra,linear algebra and commutative algebra.</p>
	<p> <b><font color="red">(i)Elementary algebra</font></b></p>
		<p> The concepts coming under elementary algebra include variables,evaluating and expressions and equations,properties of equalities and inequalities,solving the algebraic expressions and linear equations having one or two variables.</p>
		<p> <b><font color="red">(ii)Advanced algebra</font></b></p>
		<p>This is the intermediate level of algebra.This algebra has high level of equations to solve as compared to pre algebra.Advanced algebra will help us to go through the other parts of algebra such as equation with inequalities,matrices,solving system of linear equations,graphing of functions and linear equations,conic sections polynomial equation,quadratic functions with inequalities,polynomials and expressions with radicals,sequences and series,rational expressions,trigonometry and discrete mathematics and probability. </p>
		<p> <b><font color="red"><(iii)Abstract algebra</font></b></p>
			<p> It is one of the divisions in algebra which discovers the truth relating to algebraic systems independent of the specific nature of some operations.It deals with algebraic structures like the fields,groups,modules,rings,lattices,vector spaces,etc.</p>
			<p>The concepts of the abstract algebra are below-</p>
			<p>(i)SETS-It is defined as the collection of the objects that are determined by some specific property for a set.</p>
			<p>(ii)BINARY OPERATIONS-When the concept of addition is conceptualized,it gives the binary operations.The concept of all the binary operations will be meaningless without a set.</p>
			<p>(iii)IDENTITY ELEMENT-The numbers 0 and 1 are conceptualized to give the idea of an identity element for a specific operation.Here 0 is called the identity element for the addition operation,whearas 1 is called the identity element for the multiplication operation.</p>
			<p>(iv)INVERSE ELEMENTS-The idea of inverse elements comes up with a negative number.For addition, we write "-a" as the inverse of "a" and for multiplication,the inverse form is written as "a<sup>-1</sup>"</p>
			<p>(v)ASSOCIATIVITY-When integers are added,there is a property known as associativity in which the grouping up of numbers added does not affect the sum.Consider an example,(3+2)+4=3+(2+4)</p>
			<p> <b><font color="red">(iv)Linear Algebra</font></b></p>
			<p>It is a branch of algebra that applies to both applied as well as pure mathematics.It deals with the linear mappings between the vector spaces and study of planes and lines.It is the study of linear sets of equations with transformation properties.The important topics that deals in linear algebra are linear equations,vector spaces,relations,matrices and matrix decomposition and relations and computations</p>
			<p> <b><font color="red">(v)Commutative algebra</font></b></p>
			<p>Commutative algebra is one of the branches of algebra that studies the commutative rings and their ideals.The algebraic theory,as well as the algebraic geometry depends on commutative algebra.It includes rings of algebraic integers,polynomial rings and so on.Many other mathematics areas draw upon commutative algebra in different ways,such as differential topology,invariant theory,order theory,and general topology.It has occupied a remarkable role in modern pure mathematics.</p>
			<p><font size="8" color="olive">Algebraic equations</font></p>
			<p>An algebraic equation is an equation invoving only algebraic expressions in the unknowns.These are further classified by degree.</p>
			<p>(a) Linear equation-algebraic equation of degree one.</p>
			<p>(b) Polynomial equation-equation in which a polynomial is set equal to another polynomial.</p>
			<p>(c) Transcendental equation-equation involving a transcendental function of one of its variables.</p>
			<p>(d) Functional equatiom-equation in which the unknowns are ffunctions rather than simple quantities.</p>
			<p>(e) Differential equation-equation involving derivatives.</p>
			<p>(f) Integral equation-equation involving integrals.</p>
			<p>(g) Diophantine equation-equation where the only solutions of interest of the unknowns are the integer ones.</p>
			<p><font size="8" color="olive"> General algebra concepts</font></p>
			<p> <b><font color="red">Fundamental theorem of algebra</font></b>-states that every non-constant single variable polynomial with complex coefficients has atleast one complex root.This includes polynomials with real coefficients,since every real number is a complex number with an imaginary part equal to zero.</p>
